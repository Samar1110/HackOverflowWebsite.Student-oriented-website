This was our submission for the final Problem Statement of HackOverFlow.

The PS asked us to make a _student oriented website_ , for which we made **Dixtra** .
The key motivation behind it was to make something which can help it's user to manage his/her daily tasks along with upskiling himself. The site offers multiple tools to the user for the same. These include a To-Do list, Note taking section, a page to save important links, Calendar and an Upskill page with various resources. These tools will certainly help any student.
